    <p><h2>Copy Cat Denny's French Toast</h2></p>
    <p>This is a personal favorite. This french toast recipe I believe tastes better than the original! I wont try to sway you one way or the other; I'll let you be the judge of that.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Eggs</li>
        <li>2/3 Cup of Skim Milk</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup of Flour</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup of Sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of Vanilla</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of Cinnamon</li>
        <li>6-8 slices of Texas Toast or Brioche bread</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons of Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Season the shrimp.</strong> Sprinkle the raw shrimp with salt and pepper</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the shrimp.</strong> Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the shrimp on both sides for 7-8 minutes total, until they become pink and opaque. Take them out of the pan and set them aside in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the butter and garlic.</strong> Place the butter and garlic into the same pan and cook over medium heat for about a minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer the heavy cream.</strong> Pour the heavy cream into the pan and raise the heat to medium-high. Then, allow the cream to reach a simmer before taking the pan off the heat and adding the Parmesean cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the pasta and shrimp.</strong> Once the cheese has been thoroughly incorporated, add the shrimp and pasta. You can add more salt, if needed. For a little extra flavor, garnish the shrimp alfredo pasta with some chopped fresh parsley and serve.</li>
        <li><strong>Add extra parmesean cheese because you can <em>NEVER</em> have enough cheese.</strong></li>
    </ol>
