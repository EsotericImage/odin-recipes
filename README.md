# odin-recipes
This is my first website. This website will consist of a main index page with some links to a
few recipes. The use of italicized and bold characters, headers, and paragraphs will be included. This is a big first step! 

Reflection: This has been an AWESOME project. It did take some time to figure out what was wrong with my code in some spots, but overall, I did not spend too much time troubleshooting. Sometimes it was something as simple as missing a bracket. Other times, it would be due to spelling or not listing the correct path.
